# Algorand Security Token

An Algorand security token compatible with CoMakery. It was originally authored by [Derek Leung](https://github.com/derbear) at [Algorand Foundation](https://algorand.foundation/). This token is modeled on the [CoMakery Security Token specification](https://github.com/CoMakery/comakery-security-token).

It is AGPL open source licensed.

Although it is built on Algorand it follows the ERC-1404 security token standard. The contract is written in [sTEAL](https://github.com/derbear/steal) which is [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) language code that compiles to an Algorand TEAL Smart Contract.
